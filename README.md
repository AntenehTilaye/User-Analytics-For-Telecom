## Introduction

MY employer wants me to provide a report to analyse opportunities for growth and make a recommendation on whether TellCo is worth buying or selling. I will do this by analysing a telecommunication dataset that contains useful information about the customers & their activities on the network. I will deliver insights I managed to extract to my employer through an easy to use web based dashboard and a written report.
